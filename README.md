Description: This project is a Java-based console application designed to simulate a network security and antivirus system. It manages a dataset of system files, assigning each a random "risk score" (0-100) to mimic real-world security threats. The program operates through an interactive menu, allowing the user to monitor and secure the system.

Key Features:

System Scan: Displays the current risk status of all files in the array.

Threat Analysis: Algorithms detect and count files with high-risk scores (above 80) using return methods.

Manual Mitigation: Allows the administrator to neutralize a specific file by resetting its risk score to zero.

Auto-Defense Mode: Automatically iterates through the entire dataset to identify and neutralize all high-risk threats instantly.

Technical Skills:

Language: Java

Concepts: Arrays, Loops (For/While), Methods (Void/Return), Conditional Logic (If/Else), and Switch-Case Menus.
